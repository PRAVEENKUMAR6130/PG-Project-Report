## Phase 2
### Future Works
Simulation results obtained in a number of experiments by varying the traffic and firewall characteristics confirm the validity of the proposed approach
and a very good accordance with the theoretical model. Measures collected, by deploying the proposed solution in a purposely developed testbed, show that the expected performance gain determined both theoretically and through simulation is close to the actual improvements achievable
in realistic conditions can be done in future .
